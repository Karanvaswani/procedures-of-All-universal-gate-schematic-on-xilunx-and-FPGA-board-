Objective: Understand FPGA project creation and workflow using Xilinx ISE WebPACK.
Skills Covered: Project setup, constraint file usage, synthesis, implementation, bitstream generation.
Description:  learn to create new FPGA projects in Xilinx ISE, enter VHDL code, apply pin constraints, and generate programming files. The lab provides step-by-step exposure to FPGA programming and device configuration
using Digilent boards.
in this project i cvoered all all gate such as  XOR , And , nor , not , etc and their Resistor transistor logic gateon vhdl  simulation as well as FPGA board
